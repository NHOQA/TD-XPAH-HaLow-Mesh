Notes:
Requires full desktop version of latest 64 bit raspbian to work. unknown why lite ersion doesnt work. 
install drivers per teledatics docs. use mesh script to get mesh functioning.
systemd-networkd file to get dhcp on eth0
now need to be able to ping across mesh from eth0, probably need bridge

once mesh is up and hardware portable, start going through failure modes and procedures for them
then need to set up security/encryption
build out final script to handle install
